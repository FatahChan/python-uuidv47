# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This project aims to create `python-uuidv47`, a high-performance Python package using Cython to wrap a C implementation for UUIDv47 operations. The package will provide encoding of UUIDv7 into UUIDv4 facades and decoding them back, matching the performance and compatibility of the existing Node.js version while providing a clean, Pythonic API.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Python developer, I want to install a UUIDv47 library via pip, so that I can easily add UUIDv47 functionality to my projects without complex build processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user runs `pip install python-uuidv47` THEN the system SHALL install the package with pre-built wheels for major platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
2. WHEN the package is installed THEN the system SHALL provide native performance through Cython extensions
3. WHEN the installation completes THEN the system SHALL include all necessary type hints and documentation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to set encryption keys for UUIDv47 operations, so that I can control the encoding/decoding process with my own cryptographic keys.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `set_keys(k0, k1)` with two 64-bit integers THEN the system SHALL store these keys globally for subsequent operations
2. WHEN keys are successfully set THEN the function SHALL return True
3. WHEN I call `has_keys()` after setting keys THEN the system SHALL return True
4. WHEN I attempt encoding or decoding without setting keys THEN the system SHALL raise a RuntimeError with message "Keys not set"

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to encode UUIDv7 strings into UUIDv4 facades, so that I can obfuscate the temporal information while maintaining UUID format compatibility.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `encode(uuid_str)` with a valid UUIDv7 string AND keys are set THEN the system SHALL return a valid UUIDv4 facade string
2. WHEN I provide an invalid UUID format THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError with message "Invalid UUIDv7 format"
3. WHEN the encoding completes THEN the facade SHALL be a valid 36-character UUID string
4. WHEN I encode the same UUIDv7 with the same keys THEN the system SHALL produce identical facade results

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to decode UUIDv4 facades back to original UUIDv7 strings, so that I can retrieve the original temporal UUID information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `decode(facade_str)` with a valid facade AND correct keys are set THEN the system SHALL return the original UUIDv7 string
2. WHEN I provide an invalid UUID format THEN the system SHALL raise a ValueError with message "Invalid UUID format"
3. WHEN I decode a facade that was encoded with the same keys THEN the system SHALL return the exact original UUIDv7
4. WHEN I attempt to decode with wrong keys THEN the system SHALL return a different (incorrect) result without error

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate UUID string formats, so that I can verify input data before processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I call `uuid_parse(uuid_str)` with a valid UUID format THEN the system SHALL return True
2. WHEN I provide an invalid UUID format THEN the system SHALL return False
3. WHEN I provide an empty string or None THEN the system SHALL return False
4. WHEN I provide a valid 36-character UUID string THEN the system SHALL return True regardless of version

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to provide full type safety, so that I can use it confidently in type-checked Python projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I import the library in a mypy-checked project THEN the system SHALL provide complete type hints for all functions
2. WHEN I use the library functions THEN my IDE SHALL provide accurate autocompletion and type checking
3. WHEN the package is installed THEN it SHALL include a `py.typed` marker file
4. WHEN I run mypy on code using this library THEN it SHALL pass type checking without errors

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to have identical behavior to the Node.js version, so that I can use both implementations interchangeably in multi-language systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I encode the same UUIDv7 with the same keys in both Python and Node.js versions THEN both systems SHALL produce identical facade results
2. WHEN I decode the same facade with the same keys in both versions THEN both systems SHALL return identical original UUIDs
3. WHEN I use the same test vectors in both implementations THEN all results SHALL match exactly
4. WHEN I run cross-compatibility tests THEN the system SHALL verify 100% compatibility

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to have high performance, so that it can handle high-throughput UUID operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I perform encoding operations THEN the system SHALL complete at least 100,000 operations per second
2. WHEN I perform decoding operations THEN the system SHALL complete at least 100,000 operations per second
3. WHEN I run batch operations THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent performance across large datasets
4. WHEN compared to pure Python implementations THEN the system SHALL demonstrate significant performance improvements

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive error handling, so that I can handle edge cases and invalid inputs gracefully.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide invalid input types THEN the system SHALL raise appropriate TypeErrors
2. WHEN I provide out-of-range key values THEN the system SHALL raise OverflowError
3. WHEN operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear, descriptive error messages
4. WHEN I handle exceptions THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent internal state

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the library to work across all major Python versions and platforms, so that I can use it in diverse deployment environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I install on Python 3.8+ THEN the system SHALL work without compatibility issues
2. WHEN I install on Windows, macOS, or Linux THEN the system SHALL provide native performance
3. WHEN I use the library in different architectures THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent behavior
4. WHEN I deploy to production environments THEN the system SHALL be stable and reliable
